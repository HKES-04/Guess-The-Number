# Guess The Number!

This is a game where the user has to guess the correct random number that is generated. Each time a wrong number is inserted by the user it will notify the user if the number is too high or too low. Also each time they insert a wrong number they lose a point. There are 20 points if you get to 0 you lose the game.
